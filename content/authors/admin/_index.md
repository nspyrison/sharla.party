I'm a freelance R and Shiny developer specializing in enabling easy access to data and replacing manual, redundant processes with ones that are automated, reproducible, and repeatable. I also co-organize R-Ladies Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area R User Group. I like R (of course), dogs, learning Spanish, playing bass, and punk.
